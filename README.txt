# Result Component

This app allows a user to input results from fictional English exams, to get an average result and some feedback from the institute. 

## Tech used

This app uses React.JS and HTML/CSS. it also uses Styled-Components to manage CSS/styling.

## Lessons Learned

During this project I learned the importance of considering screen reactivity throughout the project. When I had initally completed the project, it became clear that the app was unusable on smaller devices. This resulted in the project taking longer than I had initially anticipated.
